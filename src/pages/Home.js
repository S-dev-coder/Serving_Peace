      World Mental Health Day has become one of the most significant events in the current times.
      
     
      The world battled the COVID pandemic in the last two years, mental health problems were seen to take a place on every table of discussion. World Mental Health Day 2022 is observed on October 10 to provide a space and day to talk about various mental health problems and encourage the mental well-being of those around us.
     The main agenda of World Mental Health Day is to help think beyond the old perceptions and remove the stigma around mental health problems. World Mental Health Day encourages people to come forward so that others with the same issues get the courage to talk about how they feel.
     As society evolves, World Mental Health Day aims at reminding people that whatever they are feeling, they donâ€™t have to face it alone, and the sooner the diagnosis is, the right treatment at the right time can be life-altering !!
